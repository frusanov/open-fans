# Open Fans Platform Roadmap

Censorship-resistant, open-protocol content publishing engine for web and federated/social protocols.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Building the **WordPress of content creation** - an open, self-hostable platform that puts creators in control of their content, audience, and revenue through multiple federation protocols.

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
