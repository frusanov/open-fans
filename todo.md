# Open Fans Platform Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

Building a **censorship-resistant, open-protocol content publishing engine** for web and federated/social protocols. The platform supports any media type, is portable and cloud-agnostic, includes creator monetization, and federates via ActivityPub, AtProto, and RSS/Atom.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What We Have
- Remix framework setup with React SSR
- PGlite database with Drizzle ORM
- TailwindCSS + Radix UI components (with custom Button component)
- TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- Basic project structure with components/ui folder
- Vite build system with modern Remix features enabled
- Inter font integration
- Class variance authority for component variants

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Gap
- **Current**: Remix-based monolith with minimal database setup
- **Target**: Hono HTTP server with pluggable architecture
- **Strategy**: Hybrid approach - introduce Hono alongside Remix, then migrate
- **Database**: Currently using PGlite (good for dev), need migration path to production PostgreSQL

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/           # Remix routes (UI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/             # Hono API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/            # Shared utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ federation/     # Protocol implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/        # Storage adapters
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/        # Plugin system
```

### Key Principles
1. **Runtime Agnostic**: All server code must work across Node.js, Bun, Deno, Workers
2. **Storage Agnostic**: Abstract all file operations behind interfaces
3. **Security First**: Sandbox all user content, validate all inputs
4. **Federation Ready**: Design APIs with federation in mind
5. **Performance**: Optimize for large files and high concurrency
6. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for customization

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Federation compatibility tests
- Performance benchmarks

## ‚ö° Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### üîß Development Environment Setup
1. **Database & Migrations**
   - [ ] Install drizzle-kit for migrations: `bun add -D drizzle-kit`
   - [ ] Create `drizzle.config.ts` configuration
   - [ ] Set up migration scripts in package.json
   - [ ] Create initial schema files in `lib/schema/`

2. **Testing Framework**
   - [ ] Install Vitest: `bun add -D vitest @vitest/ui`
   - [ ] Install Playwright: `bun add -D @playwright/test`
   - [ ] Create test configuration files
   - [ ] Set up test scripts in package.json

3. **Development Tools**
   - [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Add environment variable management (.env files)
   - [ ] Set up hot reload for development
   - [ ] Configure ESLint rules for the project

### üìä Database Schema Design
4. **Core Schema Planning**
   - [ ] Create ERD diagram (use draw.io or similar)
   - [ ] Define user authentication table structure
   - [ ] Plan content/post table with JSON metadata
   - [ ] Design media files table with fallback support
   - [ ] Plan federation-ready user profiles

5. **Implementation Priority**
   - [ ] Start with User model (extends current auth)
   - [ ] Add Post model with rich metadata
   - [ ] Create Media model with file references
   - [ ] Add basic relationship tables

### üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure Updates
6. **Organize Code Structure**
   - [ ] Create `app/lib/schema/` for database schemas
   - [ ] Create `app/lib/types/` for TypeScript interfaces
   - [ ] Create `app/services/` for business logic
   - [ ] Create `app/lib/storage/` for storage adapters
   - [ ] Update import paths in existing files

### üîê Basic Authentication
7. **User System Foundation**
   - [ ] Install auth dependencies: `bun add bcryptjs jsonwebtoken`
   - [ ] Create user registration route
   - [ ] Add login/logout functionality
   - [ ] Implement session management
   - [ ] Create protected route middleware

### üìÅ File Upload Basics
8. **Media Handling**
   - [ ] Install file upload deps: `bun add multer @types/multer`
   - [ ] Create upload endpoint in Remix action
   - [ ] Add file validation (size, type, security)
   - [ ] Implement local storage first
   - [ ] Create media serving route

## üìã Current Project Analysis

### Existing Code Review
- **Root Layout**: Uses Inter font, includes basic Button component
- **Database**: PGlite setup in `lib/db.ts` needs migration strategy
- **UI Components**: Custom Button with CVA variants, ready for extension
- **Build System**: Modern Vite + Remix with v3 features enabled
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 with utilities class merging

### Immediate Technical Debt
- [ ] Fix Button component in root layout (currently renders empty)
- [ ] Set up proper environment configuration
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode configurations
- [ ] Plan PGlite ‚Üí PostgreSQL migration path
- [ ] Create proper development/production configs

### Recommended Dependencies to Add
```bash
# Database & Auth
bun add bcryptjs jsonwebtoken @types/bcryptjs @types/jsonwebtoken
bun add drizzle-kit -D

# File Upload & Storage
bun add multer @types/multer mime-types @types/mime-types

# Testing
bun add vitest @vitest/ui @playwright/test -D

# Utilities
bun add zod uuid @types/uuid
```

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building the comprehensive open-fans platform while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on learnings and feedback.
